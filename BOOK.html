        <p style="font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature arrives to demand retribution.
            Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal,
            immortal faeries who once ruled her world.<br><br>

            At least, he's not a beast all the time.<br><br>

            As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion 
            that burns through every lie she's been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae.
            But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, 
            and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.<br><br>

            From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, 
            and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.</p><br><br>
